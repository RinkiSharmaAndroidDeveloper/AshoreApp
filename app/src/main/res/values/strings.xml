We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using our application or services or transacting business with us. By using our website or application (our “app” or “Service”), you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.\n\n
For purposes of this Agreement, “Service” refers to the Company’s service which can be accessed via our website at www.stayashore.com or through our mobile application “Ashore” available on iOS and Android in which users can create a social profile and connect to other users. By accepting our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, found at ___, you consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. The information may be sent to servers located in the United States and countries around the world.\n\n
I.INFORMATION WE COLLECT \n\n

Personal Information includes your email, mobile phone number, interests, gender, birthday, education history, relationship interests, location, photos, personal profile description, and friends/contacts. If you choose to sign up for Ashore using your Facebook login, you authorize us to access certain Facebook account information, including your public Facebook profile, consistent with your privacy settings in Facebook. This access includes the type of Personal Information described above. In addition, you authorize us to access information about your likes, and information about and photos of your Facebook friends who might be common Facebook friends with other Ashore users. \n\n
In order to provide and maintain quality of the Service, we track information provided to us by your mobile device when you download or use the Service. We may collect and store any personal information you provide while using our Service or in some other manner. This may include identifying information, such as your name, address, email address and telephone number, and if you transact business with us, financial information.

If you’re using the Ashore app, we recognize your device by using mobile device IDs, which are unique device identifiers assigned by the manufacturer. For iOS 6 and later, we use Advertising IDs instead of cookies to recognize you. Device IDs cannot be deleted, although Advertising IDs can be reset in “Settings” on your iPhone. Ad companies may use device IDs or Advertising IDs to track your use of the app, track the number of ads displayed, measure ad performance and display ads that are more relevant to you. Analytics companies use device IDs to track information about app usage.\n\n
If you access the Ashore website, you may provide us with certain information, such as the website you came from (known as the “referring URL”), the type of browser you use, the device from which you connected to the Service, the time and date of access, and other information that does not personally identify you.  We track this information using cookies, or small text files which include an anonymous unique identifier.\n\n
We may allow third party service providers, including but not limited to advertising companies and ad networks, to display advertisements on our Service. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as cookies or web beacons, to collect information about users who view and interact with their advertisements.

II.HOW WE USE AND SHARE INFORMATION\n\n
Personal Information
Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent or otherwise share for marketing purposes your Personal Information with third parties without your consent. We do share Personal Information with vendors who are performing services for the Company, such as the servers for our email communications who are provided access to user’s email address for purposes of sending emails from us.  Those vendors use your Personal Information only at our direction and in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
In general, the Personal Information you provide to us is used to help us communicate with you and provide our Service.  For example, we use Personal Information to contact users in response to questions, solicit feedback from users, provide technical support, inform users about changes to our Service, and perform research and analysis about your use of or interest in our or product or content, both individually and in aggregate.
In all circumstances, we reserve the right to use a third party vendor to perform these functions on our behalf. If you access our Service from a third party social platform, such as Facebook, we may share non-personal information with that platform to the extent permitted by your agreement with it.\n\n
Information Shared with Other Users \n\n
When you register as a user of Ashore, your Ashore profile will be viewable by other users of the Service. Other users will be able to view information you have provided us directly or through Facebook, if applicable. This includes your photos, your name, your age, location and/or approximate distance from other users, personal description, interests and likes, and common friends in Ashore or on Facebook.
If you and another Ashore user have mutually liked each other, you will form a “connection” and be able to chat, send pictures, videos, and make voice calls. Your connection will be able to see or hear any content you send in this manner. Your connections may also add their own connections to group conversations, and those users will also be able to access any content posted there.
Information Shared with Others \n\n
We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated in this Privacy Policy. We may share information with third parties that perform certain services on our behalf, including fulfilling orders, providing customer support, marketing assistance, business and sales analytics, ad tracking and analytics, user screening, and supporting the Service’s functionality and features. These service providers may have access to personal information only as needed to perform their functions. They are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes.
In addition, we may disclose your information, including personal information, for the following reasons:
•	In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency;
•	To establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;
•	When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or otherwise take action against illegal activity, suspected fraud, or other wrongdoing;
•	To protect and defend the rights, property or safety of the Company, our users, our employees, or others;
•	To comply with the law or cooperate with law enforcement;
•	To enforce our Terms of Use or other applicable agreements or policies; or
•	In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, asset sale, or declaration of bankruptcy.
We reserve the right to disclose personal information as otherwise required by law. In any such case, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.
In the event we undergo a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred.  You acknowledge and consent that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of our assets may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.  If our information practices change at any time in the future, we will post the policy changes to this website so that you may opt out of the new information practices.  We suggest that you check the site periodically if you are concerned about how your information is used.\n\n
Aggregated and/or Non-Personal Information \n\n
In general, we use Non-Personal Information to help us improve the Service and customize the user experience.  We also aggregate Non-Personal Information in order to track trends and analyze use patterns in the app.  This Privacy Policy does not limit in any way our use or disclosure of Non-Personal Information and we reserve the right to use and disclose such Non-Personal Information to our partners, advertisers and other third parties at our discretion. Any aggregated personal information to be shared is communicated with third parties in hashed, non-human readable form.
Third Party Websites
While using our Service, you may be able to click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement, or a link sent by another user, you may be taken to a website we do not control. These websites may independently solicit and collect personal and non-personal information from you, and in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. In order to determine how your information may be used by these sites, we recommend you consult the privacy policies of those websites. We also recommend you exercise discretion when clicking on a link to a third party site shared by another user.
User-Submitted Personal Information
Ashore allows you to access areas on our Service where you can post information about yourself and others. You can also communicate with others and make certain posts visible to all users, such as events. Such postings are governed by our Terms of Use. Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable pages, that information will be publicly available to all users and can be viewed and collected by others. Posts visible only to your connections can be viewed and collected by them. Outside of the limits described above, we cannot control who reads your posts or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post or share. We urge you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information.
If you have an Ashore account, you have the ability to access and update your personal information within the Service by opening your account and going to settings or to your profile. You may close your account at any time by accessing the settings for your account. If you close your account, we will retain certain information associated with your account for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, enforce our Terms of Service, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our Service or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted or required by law. Additionally, any information already provided to third parties as described in this Policy will be subject to those third parties’ policies.
You may choose not to provide us with certain information, which may result in your inability to use certain features of our Service because such information is required to either register as a user or access certain functions.
Our Service may deliver notifications to your mobile device. You can disable these notifications either in the settings in the app or by changing the notification preferences on your mobile device.\n\n
III.HOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION \n\n
We implement security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access and disclosure.  Your account is protected by your account password and/or authenticated mobile or Facebook login, and we urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe by not disclosing your password.  We further protect your information from potential security breaches by implementing certain technological security measures including encryption, firewalls and secure socket layer technology.  However, these measures do not guarantee that your information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software.  By using our Service, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks. You should also exercise care with how you handle and disclose your personal information while using our Service, and avoid sending personal information through insecure email.
Children’s Privacy \n\n
Ashore is intended for use by a general audience. However, we restrict the use of our Service to individuals age 13 and above. We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use personal information from children under the age of 13.
